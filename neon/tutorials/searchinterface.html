            # Understanding the Search Interface
            ---
            Navigate to [Sample Search](https://biorepo.neonscience.org/portal/collections/index.php) under "Search" in the main menu.
            ![1](images/search-form-01.jpg)
            ---
            This is the new search interface.
            ![2](images/search-form-02.jpg)
            ---
            The criteria are now included inside **accordions** that can be expanded or collapsed by clicking their arrow symbol on the right side of the criterion header (Animated image below).
            ![3](images/search-form-03.gif)
            ---
            Fields have a short help text below them and will be marked with a red border if an invalid value is filled in.
            ![4](images/search-form-04.jpg)
            ---
            On the right there is a panel where you will find the action buttons and the selected **criteria chips** are added dynamically.
            ![5](images/search-form-05.jpg)
            ---
            You can clear/remove a field by clicking the (x) button in the criterion chip or reset the entire form sellection by clicking the **reset** button (Animated image below).

            # Criteria
            ---
            ## Taxon
            A quick suggestion tool is triggered when 4 or more letters are typed in the taxon field, displaying the matching suggestions available in the portal's taxonomic tree.
            ![7](images/search-form-07.jpg)
            ---
            ## Collections
            Collections can be of 3 types:
            1. NEON Biorepository Collections: NEON collections with samples physically hosted at the Biorepository at ASU
            2. Additional NEON Collections: NEON collections with samples hosted at partner institutions other than ASU
            3. Other Collections from NEON sites: datasets gathered from other biodiversity portals, which were collected in NEON localities
            ---
            ## NEON Biorepository Collections
            By default only the Biorepository collections are selected. Click the (+) button next to the checkbox to open an overlay window with the full lists of collections.
            ![8](images/search-form-08.jpg)
            ---
            The modal displays the same collections organized in different tabs, according to different criteria: Taxonomic Group
            ![9](images/search-form-09.jpg)
            ---
            Criterion: NEON Theme
            ![10](images/search-form-10.jpg)
            ---
            Criterion: Sample Type
            ![11](images/search-form-11.jpg)
            ---
            To see each collection profile, click the collection title if it's blue (meaning it's available for loans/requests), or the "More Info" link if it's greyed out (meaning it's NOT available for loans/requests at the moment).
            ![13](images/search-form-13.jpg)
            ---
            The collection profile will appear in a separate window.
            ![14](images/search-form-14.jpg)
            ---
            The search will only use the actively selected collection tab. To accept your selection, click the "Accept and close" button.
            ![15](images/search-form-15.jpg)
            ---
            The selected collections codes are going to appear summarized in the criteria chips in the right panel.
            ![16](images/search-form-16.jpg)
            ---
            Note that you must select at least one collection to be able to perform a search. An alert will appear when you click the "Search" button if you fail to do so.
            ![17](images/search-form-17.jpg)
            ---
            ## Sample Properties
            By default the search will include all catalog numbers available. You can limit the search by specimens that have images or genetic data (e. g. sequences [available in the Barcode of Life Database - BOLD](http://www.boldsystems.org/)).
            ![18](images/search-form-18.jpg)
            ---
            # Locality
            The NEON Domains and Sites have been added as a list of filters to refine searches in the portal.
            ![19](images/search-form-19.jpg)
            ---
            You can expand a domain to see what sites are included in it.
            ![20](images/search-form-20.jpg)
            ---
            Clicking the site name will open a new tab with the site information at neonscience.org.
            ![21](images/search-form-21.jpg)
            ---
            Click the site(s)/domain(s) desired and note that they will appear summarized as a criterion chip in the right panel.
            ![22](images/search-form-22.jpg)
            ---
            For the nominal locality criteria note that it is only possible to search localities in the US territories.
            ---
            Latitude and Longitude criteria can also be applied using a bounding box, spatial polygon, or point-radius area.
