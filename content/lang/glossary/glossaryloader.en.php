						and then name all columns related to that term as the language, underscore, and then the column name
						(e.g., English, English_definition, Spanish, Spanish_definition, etc.). Columns can be added for the definition,
						author, translator, source, notes, and an online resource url.
						Synonyms can be added by naming the column the language, underscore, and synonym (e.g., English_synonym).
						A source can be added for all of the terms by filling in the Enter Sources box below.
						Please do not use spaces in the column names or file names.

						file size exceeds the file upload limits set within your PHP installation (see your php configuration file).';
