						Please specify the taxonomic group to which the terms will be related.
						If your file contains terms in multiple languages, label each column of terms as the language the terms are in (e.g., English),
						and then name all columns related to that term as the language, underscore, and then the column name
						(e.g., English, English_definition, Spanish, Spanish_definition, etc.). Columns can be added for the definition,
						author, translator, source, notes, and an online resource url.
						Synonyms can be added by naming the column the language, underscore, and synonym (e.g., English_synonym).
						A source can be added for all of the terms by filling in the Enter Sources box below.
						Please do not use spaces in the column names or file names.
						If the file upload step fails without displaying an error message, it is possible that the
						file size exceeds the file upload limits set within your PHP installation (see your php configuration file).';
