            # Using search results
            ---
            After picking your criteria, click the "Search" button.
            ![01](images/search-results-01.jpg)
            ---
            You will be redirected to the **search results page**.
            In the "Occurrence Records" tab that opens by default you will find 3 icons in the top corner. The first one opens a table view of the records.
            ![02](images/search-results-02.jpg)
            ---
            Table view of the search results records:
            ![03](images/search-results-03.jpg)
            ---
            The icon in the middle allows you to download the records.
            ![04](images/search-results-04.jpg)
            ---
            The download results dialog pops up. You can select whether you would like to download our results as a Symbiota Native or Darwin Core Archive file.
            ![05](images/search-results-05.jpg)
            ---
            These formats are very similar, but Symbiota Native files support more fields. Click the icon to the right of these names for brief descriptions of these file structures.
            ![06](images/search-results-06.jpg)
            ---
            You can also choose the data extensions (determination history and/or images) that you would like to include in the download, as well as the file format, and whether you would like the results as a zip file. Click the "Download Data" button when you have identified your preferences.
            ---
            In a default download, you will see a folder like below in which the "occurences.csv" file is the primary results file containing a table of all available sample-associated data.
            ![07](images/search-results-07.jpg)
            ---
            The icon on the right copies to your clipboard the exact URL address for this search, if you'd like to save it for future reference.
            ![08](images/search-results-08.jpg)
            ---
            On the left, click the "Species list" tab to display a list of species grouped by family
            ![09](images/search-results-09.jpg)
            ---
            In the "Maps" tab you will find the option to either display the results in a Google map or to export a KML file that can be opened in a Google Earth application.
            ![10](images/search-results-10.jpg)
            ---
            Clicking the "Display coordinates in Google map" button will open a pop-up window with the map.
            ![11](images/search-results-11.jpg)
            ---
            Back on the "Maps" tab in the search results, click the "Add Extra Fields" to select additional Symbiota fields to include in the KML download. Click "Create KML" to download a file that can be used for mapping in Google Earth.
